            <h3>FACTS</h3>

            <h4>
                #1 First kiss
            </h4>
            <p>
                As a teenager, Monica was always on the heavier side, due to which she was ridiculed throughout the
                show. She didn't have much in terms of a social life when she was young. As a result, the night she had
                her first kiss became very special to her. Until she found out her 'midnight mystery man' was actually a
                nightmare.
            </p>

            <h4>
                #2 Wedding fund
            </h4>
            <p>
                Monica had envisioned and planned the wedding of her dreams for a very long time. She had organized
                everything regarding and even put aside money for it. However, when she asked her parents for the fund
                they had set aside for her marriage, she learnt that it was already used to buy a beach house, as Jack
                and Judy thought Monica would never get married.
            </p>
            <h4>
                #3 Monica and Joey

            </h4>
            <p>
                Monica and Chandler are the perfect couple and it is very difficult to imagine either of them ending up
                with someone else. However, such was the plan initially. Monica’s love interest in Friends was supposed
                to be Joey.
            </p>
            <h4>
                #4 Monica's hair
            </h4>

            <p>
                Monica Geller's hair kept changing throughout the show. She went from sporting mid-length hair to a bob
                cut and a variety of other styles. In season 4, Monica cut her hair short because Courteney Cox had
                streaks in them from her role in Scream 2.
